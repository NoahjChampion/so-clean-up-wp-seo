Clean up several unwanted things that the WordPress SEO plugin adds to your WordPress Dashboard.

## Description

Almost anyone that uses WordPress SEO by Team Yoast will agree that it is *the* SEO plugin, but the developers are adding more and more unwanted things to the WordPress Dashboard.

The purpose of the SO Clean Up WP SEO is to clean up all those unwanted things.

As per the current release, the plugin removes and/or disables the following unwanted items:

* removes sidebar ads on all WordPress SEO settings pages
* removes tour-intro and button to start tour (it's globally disabled so cannot be started)
* removes the WordPress SEO settings from the Admin Bar
* globally sets plugin-tour to done
* globally sets plugin about-page as seen
* removes the keyword/description columns on edit Posts/Pages pages
